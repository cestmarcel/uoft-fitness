To get started with the application, simply clone the project and run "npm install" on your command line after navigating to your repository. Then, all you have to do is run "npm start" and the localhost port will be logged to your command line. This command also runs the seed file automatically, so your MongoDB database will be populated. Make sure to start your MongoDB locally before running "npm start"

## Usage

You can use this application to create, and track daily workouts. 

Specifically, when starting the app, you can create a new workout or continue with your last workout. You can add any number of resistance or cardio exercises to a given workout.

You can also view the last seven workouts on the stats page. The stats page will give you an overview of your last workouts.
